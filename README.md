# Airport-runway-simulation

This project was built with Visual C++. 
I used the C++ random module to simulate a busy airport runway and predict the total number of plane crashes.

What I learned:
- Object-oriented design in C++(header files, implementation files, namespaces, etc.)
- C++ random library
- Simulation Programming
